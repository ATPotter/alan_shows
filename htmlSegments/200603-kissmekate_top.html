The King And I?  Paul?  Haven't we been here before?

<p>
Well, yes, but I had been wanting to join Larbert AOS - it had a great reputation for dance, and I was
really keen on giving it another try.  So I went along, met a great bunch of people, and had lots of fun.

And learning the lines wasn't too hard!

<h3>Photographic Notes</h3>

<p>
Most of these photos were taken with the Pro1 on the dress rehearsal, when the lighting plot wasn't
complete.  I hadn't yet learned about the joys of RAW, or how much better photos could be if you didn't
use flash.  But it wasn't going to be long now...

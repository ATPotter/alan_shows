It was very strange to repeat a show, and a part so quickly, but I had been thinking about
returning to Stirling for some time and this seemed like a good opportunity.  And Heather (the choreographer) had
been a friend for some time and so I was keen to do <i>Too Darn Hot</i> with her choreography.

So, along I went and felt entirely at home very quickly.  We had a great show!

The friend who was taking pictures for me forgot to switch on the flashgun for <i>Too Darn Hot</i>, but we
noticed that the pictures in fact turned out rather well.  Oh, if only we had kept the darned thing
off for future shows!

However, I had one new toy to play with.  My first digital camera!  It was a
<a href="http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/specs/FujiFilm/fuji_mx1400.asp" target="_blank">Fujifilm Finepix 1400Z</a>, resplendent in its
1280 x 960 1.2 Megapixel resolution!  But I had great fun with this camera, and took lots of pictures I really liked.  But in
truth I don't think I knew just how much of a change to my photography digital was going to make...

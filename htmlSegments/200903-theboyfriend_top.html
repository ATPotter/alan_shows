I had seen <i>The Boy Friend</i> being performed by Edinburgh Music Theatre a couple of years before, and
thought that it would be fun to do.  But when I got the part of Bobby, and realised that I was playing
opposite Amanda, it gave me pause for thought.  She is so good on stage and such a good dancer, I wondered if
it would ever be possible to dance beside her and <i>not</i> appear to be out of my depth!

I don't know whether I managed it, but I certainly had a great time trying.  The rehearsals and the show itself
all went smoothly.  And it was lovely to be working with Dorothy again, who had directed me in <i>Carousel</i>
way back in... Ulp!... <a href="index.html#/oneShow/199110/Carousel">1991</a>!

As if that wasn't enough to make me feel old, I also got my twenty-five year long service award from NODA,
presented to my by Jim Allardyce!  It was presented to me on stage after the show - lovely!  But then again,
I was being given my twenty-five year award in a show where I was playing a seventeen year old.  Something
wrong there, surely!

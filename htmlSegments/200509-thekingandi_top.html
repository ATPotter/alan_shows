In June 2005, I was a regular participant on the Amatuer Musicals forums at
<a href="http://www.amdram.co.uk" target="_blank">Amdram.co.uk</a>.  I still visit
quite frequently - it's a great place to hang out.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, one of the other participants was Pamela Jarvis, who was organising a production
of <i>The King And I</i>.  And her King had been forced to drop out, for personal reasons.
Would I be able to learn the part of "The King" in six weeks (including one week being
away on holiday?
</p>

<p>
I have to say, it wasn't terribly easy.  There is a <i>lot</i> of dialogue.  But somehow I
managed to get the words pretty close to correct!
</p>

<p>
The production was in the "Performance Space" of the Tolbooth in Stirling.  This is somewhere
around a 150-seater, with the audience's seats coming right to the floor area that is used as a stage.
Indeed, some nights I was sitting right beside audience members during the Act Two ballet!  It was
also small enough that we didn't need microphones, and the two-piano accompaniment sounded wonderful
in that intimate environment.

I really did enjoy this show, hard work though it was.

My wife brought the children to see the Saturday matin&eacute;e show.  At the interval, I am told, she took
my daughter to the bathroom.  Jenni (the daughter) started crying that she wasn't wanting to leave
the ladies' loos.  "I don't want daddy to die," she wailed (she had been primed that that was going
to happen at the end of the show).  My wife was mortified when she later realised that she was
dragging Jenni out of the bathroom, telling her not to worry and that it would all be okay!
</p>

Of course, there was the trauma of getting myself bald - or as close to it as possible.  We took the
kids to the barber's shop so that it wouldn't be a surprise to them... but I chose not to invite them to
the chest waxing :-)

<h3>Photographic Notes</h3>

<p>
These pictures were taken with my Canon Powershot Pro1, a great camera which unfortunately got soaked
in a Taiwanese tropical storm and died.  I think that they were mostly taken with flash, but some of the
ones without flash really do look quite good - if somewhat red.
</p>

<p>
I was gradually closing in on a decent solution...

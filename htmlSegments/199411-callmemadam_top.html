Heather Shrimpton, who had been in the Stirling show, told me about Forth Dimension in
South Queensferry, where she was choreographer.  It sounded like fun, so I went along.

The amazing thing about Forth Dimension was the amount of work that the company did to
convert the school hall into an authentic-looking theatre.  A few lighting towers and
an abundance of blacks can make a place look really impressive!  And then , of course, it all has
to be taken down after the show is over.

Anyone who complains about noise levels in today's digital cameras should go back and look at
real-world scans of 35mm negatives.Marie did a great job with these dress rehearsal pictures, but
the noise levels were so high that even the ones that are in focus look bad.  Any imperfect exposure
and the images look dreadful.  This is Fuji HG1600 film, and beside it my "dated" Canon EOS350D looks
wonderful!

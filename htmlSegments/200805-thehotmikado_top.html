In something that seemed to be becoming a habit, I was on holiday when I got a phone call from Alex Kemp.  The
person who was playing Pish Tush in <i>The Hot Mikado</i> had been forced to drop out.  Would I be able to help?

After a check with my wife, I said "yes".

It was wonderful to be reunited with friends from previous shows.  I knew Alex from <a href="../1999-chess/">Chess</a>,
Gillian from various shows with Forth Dimension and both Rosalie and Jerry from <a href="../1997-carousel/">Carousel</a>.

The part of Pish-Tush was easy to learn - there was very little for him to do.  But the dancing!  Wow!  There was a lot
to learn in a short time (six weeks, I think).  I mostly had it by the last night :-)   But I had a great time - it
was a great bunch of people!

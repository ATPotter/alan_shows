Wot's this? 'Arf A Sixpence again?  (Yes, my accent was indeed as corny as that!)

The good news was that we were in the macrobert again.  It was nice to be in a theatre again; the
Albert Halls are a very nice concert hall, but that's different from a theatre.  The macrobert had
been refurbished in the year we were off, and was now the bluest auditorium I had ever seen - blue
walls, blue carpet and <i>very</i> blue seats!

And so we did <i>Sixpence</i>.  As I've said before, it isn't a favourite show of mine, but we still
had a good time doing it.

<p>Taking part in <i>Into The Woods</i>, and performing it outdoors <i>in</i> the woods?  What an experience!<p>

<p>Pamela, the director, explained in her programme notes that she had fallen in love with Sondheim when an English
lecturer used the complex lyrics of "On The Steps Of The Palace" to explain a point of English literature.  And it
had been her long-time ambition to perform the show.</p>

<p>She arranged with the <a href="http://www.doubletreedunblane.com/">Dunblane Hydro Hotel</a> that we could perform the
show on its wonderful front lawn.  The tech guys did a great job of setting up a stage between two fantastic trees,
and we were ready to go</p>

<p>I had never performed any Sondheim before, and have to admit it left me cold until the day of the dress rehearsal.
Suddenly the music and drama came together for me, and I was really excited to be taking part.</p>

<p>So what was the experience of performing outside like?  Sure, there were downsides - there wasn't a level
surface to be found, we started warm and were frozen by the end of the evening, and anyone who had bare skin got
more insect bites than they could count!  But the way the evening gradually darkened to bring the audience
ever further into the experience, the wonderful atmosphere, and the sheer novelty made it a wonderful week
I shall never forget!</p>

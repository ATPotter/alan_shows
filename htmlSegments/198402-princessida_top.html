<p>
After the glowing success (or whatever) of 
<a href="/index.html#/oneShow/198302/The%20Pirates%20Of%20Penzance%20and%20The%20Zoo">The Zoo and  The Pirates of Penzance</a>,
I returned to the Savoy Club in Glasgow.</p>

<p>This year's show was Princess Ida, one of Gilbert and Sullivan's lesser-known
works.  It is full of glorious music, but that may be its downfall.
It is rather <i>too </i>full of glorious music - to the extent that it is in
three Acts.  Or to be more exact, it is described as being in &quot;a
Prologue and two Acts&quot;.  Whatever it's called, that means two trips to
the bar and a rather long show.</p>

<p>The show was good fun to do, once again Kathryn Lloyd-Evans sang
beautifully.  I also discovered that a costume of tights and a tunic could
be very uncomfortable, especially when the tunic barely went down past the
backside and tights barely came up to the knees!</p>

<p>I don't have any production photos of this show, but I do have some rehearsal pictures
that I will try to provide as soon as I can.</p>

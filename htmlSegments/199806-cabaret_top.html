I had had such a good time doing Carousel with June Geissler that I
wanted to do another show with her as soon as possible, so when I heard the she was choreographing
<i>Cabaret</i> I was signed up for it immediately!

One of the highlights was undoubtedly having the cast photo (below - thanks to Alistair Thomas) taken.
It was a Sunday lunchtime, in front of the theatre and just beside a very busy main road.
I'm amazed we didn't cause an accident!

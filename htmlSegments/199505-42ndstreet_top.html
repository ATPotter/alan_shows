For the "Year Of Dance", Clackmannan District Council organised a production of 42nd Street, and I was delighted
to take part.

My tap dancing skills were essentially nil, and the chreographer explained what she was aiming for.  "We'll have the guys
behind the girls," she explained.  "Guys, just try to get the arms going the same way as the girls'.  Nobody will see your
feet!"

I think that was an exaggeration.  I hope it was!  But whatever the case was, this turned out to be a fantastic show.  The
exuberance of the finale, with those taps building throughout, led loads of folk to ask me where they could learn to tap
dance!  It was great fun, really exciting.

This is a show I'd enjoy doing again.  But I'd still be hiding behind the girls!

Alas, I have no production pictures.  Well, nothing that's not blurred beyond use anyway.  All I have is these two pictures from
one of the rehearsals.

<p>Hey, look up there - <i>Second Yeoman </i>- my first part!&nbsp; </p>
<p>Want to know what I sang solo?&nbsp; Here it is:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quote">&quot;We hunted low&quot; ...
&quot;We hunted there&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not just that, but even a full stanza:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="quote">Didst thou not when
prisoner taken<br>
And debarred from all escape<br>
Face with gallant heart unshaken<br>
Death in most appalling shape?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Things were definitely looking up!</p>

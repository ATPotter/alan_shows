In Summer 1990, I graduated from Glasgow University, and took a job in Newbury (in the south of England).
I thought that that would be the end of my association with The Savoy Club, and Glasgow theatre in general.

However, it turned out that the job was moving to Livingston, and within a few months I found myself back
living with my parents near Glasgow, and so I went along to see if I could re-join the Savoy Club, even
at that late stage.  Perhaps surprisingly, I was allowed back in.

While I had been away, the King's Theatre had had a new electronic sign installed.  It was having teething troubles.
The previous show to ours had been a pantomime called <i>Babes In The Wood</i>.  When the time came to replace
the title with our show's name, the sign did not correctly erase the old show's name.  Or maybe someone just
thought that our show was excellent...  (see the first photograph below).

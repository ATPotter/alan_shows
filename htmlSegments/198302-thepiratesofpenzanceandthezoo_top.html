In 1983, a callow youth of just sixteen years, I performed in &quot;The Zoo&quot; and
&quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; with the Glasgow Savoy Club.  It was my
first show outside of school.</p>

<p>Imagine my surprise when, after a fairly lengthy introduction, we started
singing.  I kid you not - we spent over twenty minutes on the word
&quot;Hail&quot;.  And then more than ten minutes on &quot;Po&quot;.
Just before tea-time, we got to join them up, eventually this became &quot;Hail
Poetry&quot;</p>

<p>I don't imagine there are many clubs where things are taken to that level of
detail these days!</p>

<p>I remember being stunned by the quality and power of the voices there.
It was the first time I had ever been unable to hear myself when I was singing,
the singers around me were so good.  And then came Kathryn Lloyd-Evans, a
superb soprano who made Mabel sound both amazingly powerful and ridiculously
easy.  I was absolutely knocked out - she was superb! </p>

<p>Here are two scans from the only photo of this show that I have. The first
one a group scene from &quot;Pour Oh Pour The Pirate Sherry&quot; </p>

<p>And the second, a close-up of me.  Hey, it's a vanity site, remember?</p>

One memory I do have of this show is working the "knife board".  One character was doing a knife throwing act
while another lead was where the knives were being thrown.  I had to hide behind the board, pulling a string to
release knives which shot through the board, creating the appearance of the knife having been thrown.

One night, the string on the lock snapped, with the lock half-way released.  There was nothing I could do
but wait as the spring eventually released the knife, long after the knife throwing act was complete!

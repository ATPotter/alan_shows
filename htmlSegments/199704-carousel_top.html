I don't remember how I got into this show, but I was glad that I did!

<i>Carousel</i>, I have to admit, is not my favourite show.  But the chreographer of this society,
a lady called June Geissler, made it tremendous fun.  She had been a professional dancer, she knew
what she wanted and she worked you until she got it.  I sweated more for this show than any I have been
in before or since, and I loved it.

June had me doing things I would not have believed possible - shoulder lifts, cartwheel lifts, all sorts
of things.  I loved this show, coming home from every rehearsal drenched in sweat and desperate for the next one!

In these photos, much of the colour from the illuminated backdrops has been killed by the strong flashgun I used.
Unfortunately this results in rather dull photos.

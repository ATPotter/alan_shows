Having taken part in the Dunblane Centre pantomime I was invited to take part in the summer show, <i>Annie</i>.
</p>

<p>
As before, this was a show for the kids.  The adults held the principal parts together, but the main focus was on the kids in the chorus, giving them a chance to
put on a show in a week.
</p>

<p>
From the Monday morning to the Friday afternoon over eighty kids rehearsed the show, and we put on a pretty competent performance of <i>Annie</i>.  Indeed, the
bulk of the mistakes probably came from the principals, who had spent all their time getting the kids to rehearse and thus hadn't taken the time to rehearse their own scenes.

Well, that's my excuse and I'm sticking to it!

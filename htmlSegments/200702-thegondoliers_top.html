In October 2006 I was becoming seriously concerned about whether I would be able to find a show to do over the
winter time.  I had had a couple of societies in mind, but it turned out that they were both doing shows that
would be inapproriate to take the children along to see.  I couldn't think of what to do.
</p>

<p>
One Friday evening I was shopping in Tesco, South Queensferry, when my phone rang.  The caller wondered if I
might be willing to help Dunfermlin Gilbert and Sullivan Society, who were trying to cast Luiz in <i>The
Gondoliers</i>?  After some thought, I realised that this would work perfectly.
</p>

<p>
I had fond memories of the Society, having done Princess Ida there in <a href="index.html#/oneShow/199203/Princess%20Ida">1992</a>,
and indeed there were still a few folk that I recognised there.  And Peter Macfarlane had directed SABOS for a
couple of shows too, so I felt quickly at home.
</p>

<p>
Luiz is an unexpectedly small role; he is only on with the chorus at the final&eacute;.  As a result this was quite
a strange show to do, as I knew the principals I was working with but hardly anyone else in the company.  Of
course, by the time that show week had come and gone I knew everyone, but it was a little strange until then.
</p>

<p>
I also have to say that it was one of the best-organised companies I have ever been in.  Being able to leave your shirt
in a bag and come in to find it washed overnight is simply luxury!

<h3>Photographic Notes</h3>

<p>
This was something of a revelation, photographically speaking.
</p>

<p>
I had bought a Canon EOS350D digital SLR, and frankly it wasn't my friend.  Outdoors, I just could not get
photographs that were anywhere near as clear and sharp as those with my Pro1.  I had returned it to be
checked, and was told it was working just as expected.  I was totally lost.
</p>

<p>
And then I borrowed a colleague's 70-200mm f/4.0 L lens, and the friend who took photographs of the show used it.
Now, it was arguably a little on the long side for the Carnegie hall, but the colour reproduction and the
sharpness of the photographs took my breath away.  In one set of pictures it was instantly clear what the difference
was - Canon's L-series glass.
</p>

<p>
As soon as I could afford it, I went out and bought a Canon 24-105mm f/4.0 L lens, and went out to play with it.
Soon thereafter I started <a href="http://www.stagepics.co.uk" target="blank">StagePics</a>, where I was able to
practise stage photography.  I won't say that I've got it right, but I now understand dramatically more than I
did before!

Somehow, I had managed to avoid the "Cowboy Musicals" for many years, but this time
they finally caught up with me, as I did <i>Calamity Jane</i>.

On the positive side, I think that this was my first proper stage kiss.  On the negative
side, one has to say that Danny Gilmartin is one of <i>the</i> most boring people in all
of stage musicals!

The show was good fun to do, though from memory the naked lady above the bar of the
Golden Garter didn't even survive to the first night!

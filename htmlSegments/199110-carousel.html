I was still living with my parents near Glasgow, saving towards a deposit for somewhere to
live on my own.  So it was inevitable I would look for a show, and <i>Carousel</i> was it.

I felt a little more able to relax into the dancing, but was still very nervous.  However,
I thoroughly enjoyed my time doing the show and this time my voice held out for the week!

For a variety of reasons, SABOS was doing a staged concert rather than a conventional musical, and I
decided to get involved.  There was a new director who was taking the company along a new route.  Having
seen some of his work before, I was keen to be in a production he was directing.

I thoroughly enjoyed the rehearsals and the show.  Because it was not a "book show", there were many more
opportunities for the chorus to be on stage than usual and in the end we put on a great entertainment.

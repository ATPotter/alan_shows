My first association with the show was back in 1982, when a friend brought the "Black Album" round
to my house.  I had bought my own copy of it within a week, and listened to it time and time again.
Another friend bought me a ticket to the show in the West End for my 21st birthday, and we got to see it
within weeks of it opening.

Much as I hate describing it as such, it's one of my favourite shows.
So when Alex Kemp phoned me up asking if I would like to dance in the show, I almost bit
his hand off!

Rehearsals started in late October or early November (I can't remember which) and were quite intense.

The show itself was done in a slightly strange manner.  The music is very complex, and the production
team felt that they had seen too many productions where the music didn't have full justice done to it
because the singers were too busy moving.  So instead they had a seated chorus, and only the principals
and the dancers moved.  And we moved a lot!

It was a great show, and I really enjoyed doing it.  And if anyone in the area is doing it again, please
let me know!

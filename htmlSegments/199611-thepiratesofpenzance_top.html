When I heard that Forth Dimension was doing <i>The Pirates Of Penzance</i>, I just
knew that I had to be involved.  Ever since seeing
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086112/" target="_blank">the movie of the Joseph Papp production</a>,
I had been wanting to do the show.  So I was delighted to have a go at it, and to get the rôle of the
Pirate King.

The show wasn't the Broadway version, but was still great fun and I really enjoyed the week!

SABOS was doing Oliver, and I really couldn't face the prospect of another child-centred musical.
So instead I went along to my local society, Falkirk Operatic Society.
</p>

<p>
I had hoped that I would be able to get the part of Francis Fryer - my get-up for the auditions was
something to behold - but in the end I was delighted to be given the part of Danny Gilmartin.

The show was great fun; I thoroughly doing a local show.

<h3>Photographic Notes</h3>

<p>
This was the first time that my show pictures were taken with a digital camera.  Most of them were shot
with a Fujifilm S7000 with a hotshoe mounted flashgun, although some were taken without flash using a Canon
Ixus camera.  The flashgun offered no manual control, so it was either too bright or it was switched off!
</p>

<p>
The Ixus, on the other hand, was fired with no flash, and it did produce a few very good pictures.
</p>

<p>
My friend who shot with the S7000 remarked that the zoom sometimes "stuck".  A few weeks later, I was shooting
a show and found exactly the same.  I returned it to the manufacturer and was given a refund.
</p>

<p>
That left the question of how to replace it.  I didn't have the money for an SLR for shows and a regular camera
for holidays, so I bought a Canon Powershot Pro1.  It was a gorgeous camera, which took first-class low-ISO
pictures until it died in a Taiwanese tropical storm.  But it didn't have the high-ISO performance of an SLR, and
so it would still be a good while before I was able to ditch the flashgun altogether...

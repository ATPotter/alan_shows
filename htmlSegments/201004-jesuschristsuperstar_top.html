When news of this show came out, I was really keen to get involved.  But then I was forced to change job, and found myself
travelling, and unable to keep up the commitment.  Sadly, I had to drop out.  But when I later joined the Limelight
Productions, I found that there was still a requirement for a couple of bit players, and so I was able to take a part as
one of the Roman guards,

This was a remarkable show.  I saw tears at every production rehearsal.  There were even tears at the band call, so powerful
was the show, the music and the direction.  There was a focus and an intensity that I had only ever seen at Summer School.  There
wasn't a single "hanger-on" in the company, nobody giving it less than their all.  And it showed in the power of the
performances.

Truly, this was a remarkable show.

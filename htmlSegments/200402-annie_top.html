<i>Annie</i> and I would normally be expected to go together like... milk and vinegar, or mellon and red wine.
So in all fairness I should say up front that I enjoyed this show much more than I expected to.

Somehow I ended up with four parts here!  The <i>Star To Be</i> part is a challenge because there is a
really tricky key change just before the entry, but with a lot of work we were able to get that sorted out.
<i>Fred</i> gets to sing a great solo in the "Herbert Hoover" number, and Fred McCracken is the ventriloquist
in the radio studio scene that opens Act Two.

Francis Perkins is quite interesting.  Remember <i>Calamity Jane</i>, where there is confusion between
Franc<b>i</b>s Fryer and Franc<b>e</b>s Fryer?  Well, Franc<b>e</b>s Perkins was the first female USAan
cabinet member.  When I played her she was a baritone!

In these photographs, your eyes are not deceiving you.  There are two Annies.  For legal reasons,
there had to be two Annies, and there was only one dress rehearsal.  So both Annies did the dress
rehearsal.

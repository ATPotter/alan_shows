<h2>...in a day!</h2>

<p>A show in 24 hours?</p>

<p>It was great fun.  <i>Fame</i> splits itelf up quite nicely into separate roles for
the students and the teachers.  The adults played the teachers' roles, and the kids
(restricted to those in high school) played the students.  And to make it more fun,
neither the kids nor the adults were allowed to see the script until the rehearsal
started - so for the performers it truly was a show in 24 hours</p>

<p>That didn't leave a lot of time to learn lines, of course, so for some of the
scenes we used scripts.  And some of the more... adult... numbers were cut.  But
we still managed to put on a creditable performance, all within 24 hours from
when we first met to start the task</p>

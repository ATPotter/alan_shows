<p>A large number of the people who did the Forth Dimension shows (rehearsing
over the summer) were also members of the Bo'ness Amateur Operatic Society (rehearsing
over the winter).  So, since I had enjoyed working with Forth Dimension, I 
joined up with Bo'ness too!</p>

<p>One of my great rehearsal memories was from when we were setting "Havana".  At one point in 
this, Sammy - one of the dancers - had to slap my face.  One rehearsal,
she missed and instead hit my glasses, which went sailing across to the other side of the
rehearsal hall.  Luckily, they remained intact!</p>

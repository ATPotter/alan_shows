In September 1999 I heard that Bathgate was doing <i>Kiss Me Kate</i>.  This was a show
that I had seen in Glasgow around the time I was sitting my highers and needed a break from
studying.  I remembered something about a pretty cool dance to open Act Two, so I decided to
go along to Bathgate and find out what was happening.

I turned up at the appointed place and time, only to find out that I had been given some
bad information in fact the read-through was on.  I made my apologies and started to leave,
but since it turned out that they didn't have anyone to play the part of Paul they were
willing to give me a try.  A quick audition later, and I stayed at the read-through!

The shows was great fun, and I really enjoyed it.  And <i>Too Darn Hot</i> is still a
fantastic song!

Of course, nothing is ever simple.  My grandmother had a ninetieth birthday party on the Saturday evening before dress
rehearsal (on Sunday evening).  Only problem was that the party was in Alicante, in Spain.  I ended up getting up at
stupid o'clock on the Sunday morning after the party, and driving from Alicante to Madrid.  From there two flights
got me to Edinburgh Airport in time for me to drive to Bathgate and arrive just as the dress rehearsal started.

That also means I have no production photos, just backstage ones.

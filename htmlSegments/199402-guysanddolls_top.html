My first year in Stirling introduced me to a different kind of company from those that
I had been in before.  The company was dominated by the ferocious but absolutely wonderful
Anne Ballantyne, yet the music was very disciplined and well performed.  The choreographer
was organised; the dancers walked around in leotards, the club was simply very professional
and highly organised in its outlook.  I loved it!
</p>

<p>
Another interesting aspect was that this club did a two-week run.  Starting again on the Monday was tough!
</p>

<p>
For the first time, I managed to get my wife-to-be to take show photos too - so I even appeared in some of the photos!
</p>

<p>
Not only did I do the show, but I also got very involved in the club's concert party - I
sang in countless church halls and the like throughout Stirling and its environs.
I was in my element, I felt instantly that Stirling was a place I wanted to put down roots.

Well, I've not managed it, yet.  But there's still time!</p>

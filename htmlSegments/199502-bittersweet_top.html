Noel Coward's <i>Bitter Sweet</i> is not a terribly well-known piece, and is not often performed now.
In many ways, that is a shame.  It is chock-full of beautiful tunes, in a lyrical operetta style.

However, that my be its problem - it is <i>too</i> full of beautiful music, and is longer than today's
audiences really want to sit through.  And its three acts are also more than they want to
stomach.

All in all, I don't think that either the audience or the club really enjoyed this show.  But if you ever
get a chance to listen to the music, <i>do</i> - it's wonderfully lush, romantic stuff.

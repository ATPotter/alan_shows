SABOS's usual home - the macrobert in Stirling University - was closed for refurbishment, and this year's show was held in the
Albert Halls, in the town centre.  It now means that I have performed in both the Albert Halls and the Carnegie Hall!

The show photographs turned out extremely badly.  That was my fault.  The friend who normally takes these
photographs for me turned up at the house, and I gave him my camera, lenses and flashgun.  "What about film?"
he asked.  Oops...

We made do with what I had lying around, but that included some pretty awful ISO200 stock.  As a result, these
photographs are very noisy.

As before, I snapped a few backstage pictures with the digital camera.

This was the first time I had done a show with a major society that was not the Savoy Club, and the
experience was fascinating.
</p>

<p>
The first thing that I noticed was that the atmosphere in the club was very different.  The Savoy Club
was almost entirely focused on the music, with actions required to support, but never overwhelm,
the singing. The Minerva Club focused much more on what was being done on stage, with the music being important,
but perhaps less so.

And then there was this new thing - dancing!  I had never really tried it before, and any time I thought of it
I probably subscribed to the general view that it was a bit... well... girly a thing to do.  How wrong I was!
The sheer challenge of doing a dance - of remembering what to do and when to do it, and of working properly
with your partner, is something so exciting.  And when you're working together, holding onto each other, the
sweat pouring off you both, and something goes <i>just right</i>...  It's something I realised I loved doing and
have been continuing it ever since!

<h3>Losing my voice</h3>

<p>This was not only my first decent-sized part, it was also the first time I had lost my voice.  And it was hell.</p>

<p>The Monday and Tuesday nights went very well.  But I awoke on the Wednesday unable to speak, never mind sing.
And as the day went on, that feeling got worse rather than better.
For the Wednesday, Thursday and Friday nights I had to mime onstage while someone else sang in for me on a radio mike.
I can say with certainty that it was among the worst feelings I have ever had relating to being on stage.
</p>

<p>
An interesting side effect was that I discovered for the first time that I had a voice that others followed.
This showed itself up in the chorus "Song of a summer night," in Act Two. This chorus is driven by the basses.
What I hadn't realised was that I was generally driving the basses.
When I couldn't sing, nor did the bass section.
And the entire number fell apart.  But by the following night, the basses had learned their line and all went smoothly.
</p>

<p>
On the Saturday matinee I tried singing for myself and to my pleasure everything was working again,
making the after show party much more fun!  But I have to confess that I still hang back from going
for the really major roles in shows, just in case that hell should revisit me.

In December 1991 I bought a flat in Dalgety Bay.  So I moved away  from my parents' house
and set up home in the east of Scotland.  Of course, I started looking for a show to do and
was delighted to find a Gilbert and Sullivan society in Dunfermline.  All the more so when they
let me come along at this later stage and join in with their production of <i>Princess Ida</i>.

By the time I came along it was obviously far too late to go for a principal role, but
the show was still great fun and I enjoyed taking part.

The funniest part of the show was the costumes.  Apparently the costumiers didn't quite get the
idea of the soldiers being in mediaeval costunes - the best they were able to come up with was
something that looked like flapper girls' dresses!   Luckily that got sorted out before we
went on stage...

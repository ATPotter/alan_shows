Hey, it's Panto time again!  I really enjoyed last year's panto, so I was delighted to get another shot at it
</p>

<p>
This time, the panto was "Jack And The Beanstalk".  I was to play the part of the Prime Minister.  The King's
right-hand man.  Unfortunately, since the kingdom has been paying huge amounts of money out to keep the Giant happy,
the whole government has been laid off.  So in fact I am not only the Prime Minister, but the entire Government
and Civil Service rolled into one.  Guess it must keep me busy!

In the final run-up to the show, we suffered some quite remarkable snow:

This caused some significant problems for rehearsals, and even for the cast getting to the show itself.  But in the best of traditions the
show did indeed go on, and we had a great time once again.

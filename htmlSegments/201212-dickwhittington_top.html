<p><i>The Sound Of Music</i> is undoubtedly a great movie.  And I guess it might be a good show for the audience too, but I would have to say that for the male chorus, it is a disaster.  Indeed,
given the experiences of some local societies, it would have to describe it as being very close to a club-killing show.<p>

<p>Luckily, Limelight had no such problems this time, as they put on a first-class production of the show, and managed to achieve the delicate balance of achieving an audience and keeping the club members.</p>

<p>For myself, I got to sing exactly two words in the show itself - I can't remember whether they were "good-bye" or "good night" but in either case it wasn't overly taxing.  And then after the bows there was a
"Sound Of Music megamix" which was good fun.  However, it was great fun with a great bunch of people, so well worth taking part.</p>

Some shows go well from the start, some show just have everything going wrong.  This one, sadly, was the latter case.

From people falling ill to being posted abroad, everything that could go wrong seemed to do so in this production.  Yet, in the end, it was
a damned fine production of a marvellous, though flawed, show.  I had a great time, really enjoyed being in the show and the company.  I was so busy in
Act One that I even had my own dresser - posh or what?!

Back to South Queensferry!  <i>Half A sixpence</i> was a show I had never done
before, and in truth I probably would not rush to do it again.  It was okay, but
not one of my favourite shows.
</p>

<p>
My main memory of this show was the last night.  My trousers, which had behaved perfectly
all week, decided to split from waistband to mid-thigh just before my last exit.
That night, the wardrobe mistress wasn't around, so I had to make repairs with safety pins.
</p>

<p>
The pins lasted fine through the curtain calls until the club President started making
her speech, when I shifted my weight and suddenly became aware of a needle sticking
deeply into my thigh.  But the President was right in front of me, making her speech!
I just had to keep grinning...!
